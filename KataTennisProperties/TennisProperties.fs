// The following five properties aren't particularly useful, because they
// mainly reproduce the implementation details of the score function. I've
// added them here in order to demonstrate that this can be done, but unless
// you're in an extremely fault-sensitive setting (medical equipment, guidance
// software for vehicles, etc.) they most likely add little to negative value.
// After all, the tests contain more code than the implementation itself.
